# Undertale 2 Setup Guide

## Connecting to an Archipelago room
1. Download The Undertale 2 Randomizer from it's github releases page.
2. Open `Start Game.bat` to start the game.
3. Create a new save and click through the intro until it prompts you for your archipelago connection info.  Note that your inputs will only display in the rpgmaker console window.
4. Once you input your ip, port, slot name and (optionally) password, you should be connected!

It's recommended to also have Text Client (or Universal Tracker) opened as the game currently won't tell you what items you are recieving or sending otherwise!
